 <p>The day we started talking, I had no idea that I would fall for you this hard.  However, as days passed
    I fell in love with you more and more by each passing day.
    The way you smile, the way you laugh is mesmerizing like a lavender field dreamy like a starry night , 
     it bewitches my soul like no other sound can.
    Whenever you cry i hurts my heart in a way i can't describe .
    I will happily drain my blood drop by drop if that means you will smile for once
    In your black eyes i see my home . They are not just simple black they are dark and shining with the subtle 
    shade of obsidian orb . They are like  midnight skies of winter night where snowflakes shimmer like diamonds
     when moonlight hits them. They hold the calmness and peace only a home can .
    I love you till the moon and i hope you love me back. So,</p>
